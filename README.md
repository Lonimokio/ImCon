# ImCon (WIP)

ImCon (short for image converter) is a useful tool originally designed to take image location from a database, sort them, and convert them to webp format. This tool is intended to help websites that use databases to store images by making the websites lighter, faster, and easier to use.

## Features

- Convert images from database to webp format
- Sort images from database
- Improve website performance by reducing image size

## Future Plans

We have many plans for future development, including:

- Normal file conversion from the computer
- Support for more image formats
- Command-line interface

Stay tuned for updates!
